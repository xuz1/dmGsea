# dmGsea
## Efficient Gene Set Enrichment Analysis for DNA Methylation Data
## Introduction
The R package <b>dmGsea</b> is specifically designed for DNA methylation data, provides functions to perform gene set enrichment analysis while addressing probe dependency and probe number bias. The package supports Illumina 450K, EPIC, and mouse methylation arrays and can be extended to other omics data with user-provided probe-to-gene mapping annotations.
