Description: The R package dmGsea provides efficient gene set enrichment 
    analysis specifically for DNA methylation data. It addresses key biases,
    including probe dependency and varying probe numbers per gene. The package
    supports Illumina 450K, EPIC, and mouse methylation arrays. Users can also
    apply it to other omics data by supplying custom probe-to-gene mapping 
    annotations. dmGsea is flexible, fast, and well-suited for large-scale 
    epigenomic studies.
