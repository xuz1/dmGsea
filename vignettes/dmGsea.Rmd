# Introduction

In DNA methylation data, genes are often represented by variable 
number of correlated probes, and a single probe can map to multiple genes. This complex data structure 
poses significant challenges for gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), and can lead to biased enrichment results.
The `r Biocpkg("dmGsea")` package offers several  
functions with novel methods specifically designed to perform efficient gene set enrichment analysis while 
addressing probe dependency and probe number bias. 
Compared to alternative packages for DNA methylation data, these methods effectively utilize probe 
dependancy information, provide higher statistical power, can well control type I errer rates, and 
are computationally more efficient. The package fully supports enrichment analysis for Illumina DNA 
methylation array data, and is easily extendable to other types of omics data when provided with 
appropriate probe annotation information.

# Example Analysis

The following examples are brief demonstrations on how to perform gene set enrichment analysis using 
dmGsea functions.

## Example 1: Differentially methylated probes from EWAS

```{r example1,eval=TRUE,echo=FALSE, results="hide", message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
require(dmGsea)
#generating example data
annopkg="IlluminaHumanMethylation450kanno.ilmn12.hg19"
anno <- minfi::getAnnotation(eval(annopkg))
probe.p=data.frame(Name=rownames(anno),p=runif(nrow(anno)))
Data4cor=matrix(runif(nrow(probe.p)*100),ncol=100)
rownames(Data4cor)=rownames(anno)

#geneset enrichment analysis with threshold based method
#for top ranked 1000 genes
gsGene(probe.p=probe.p,Data4Cor=Data4cor,arrayType="450K",nTopGene=1000,outGenep=TRUE,
	 method="Threshold",gSetName="KEGG",species="Human",outfile="gs1",ncore=50)

if(FALSE){
#for significant genes at FDR threshold of 0.05
gsGene(probe.p=probe.p,Data4Cor=Data4cor,arrayType="450K",FDRthre=0.05,
         method="Threshold",gSetName="KEGG",species="Human",outfile="gs2",ncore=50)

        gSetName="KEGG",species="Human",outfile="gs1_2",ncore=50)

#Using probe level p-value directly without combine p-values, and use noncentral 
#hypergeometric test to adjust for bias due to variable number of probes per gene
gsProbe(probe.p=probe.p,nTopProbe=1000,arrayType="450K",gSetName="KEGG",
	  species="Human",ncore=50)
}
```

```{r example2, eval=TRUE,echo=FALSE, results="hide", message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#generatin example dataset
kegg=getKEGG(species="Human")
gene1=unique(as.vector(unlist(kegg[1:5])))
gene2=unique(as.vector(unlist(kegg[6:length(kegg)])))
gene1=rep(gene1,sample(1:10,length(gene1),replace=TRUE))
gene2=rep(gene2,sample(1:10,length(gene2),replace=TRUE))
p11=runif(length(gene1))*(1e-3)
p2=runif(length(gene2))
geneid=c(gene1,gene2)
p=c(p11,p2)
Name=paste0("cg",1:length(p))

gene=unique(as.vector(unlist(kegg)))
p=runif(length(gene))
names(p)=gene
stats=-log(p)*sample(c(1,-1),length(p),replace=TRUE)

if(FALSE){
#traditional GSEA analysis, enrichment toward higher or lower end of statstics
stats=sort(stats,decr=TRUE)
gsRank(stats=stats,gSetName="KEGG",scoreType="std",outfile="gs9",nperm=1e5,ncore=50)
#enrichment of genes with higher statistics
stats=sort(abs(stats),decr=TRUE)
gsRank(stats=stats,gSetName="KEGG",scoreType="std",outfile="gs10",nperm=1e5,ncore=50)

#enrichment with threshold based method
probe.p=data.frame(Name=gene,p=p)
GeneProbeTable=data.frame(Name=gene,entrezid=gene)
#the following two functions generate equivalent results 
gsGene(probe.p=probe.p,nTopGene=500,GeneProbeTable=GeneProbeTable,gSetName="KEGG",outfile="gs11",ncore=5)
gsProbe(probe.p=probe.p,nTopProbe=500,GeneProbeTable=GeneProbeTable,gSetName="KEGG",outfile="gs12",ncore=5)
}
```

# Gene set and pathway databases

The package includes built-in support for KEGG, GO, MSigDB, and Reactome gene sets for both human and mouse pathways. All functions also offer options to incorporate custom, user-provided gene sets.

## Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)

The KEGG pathway database is a widely used resource that provides 
a comprehensive collection of manually curated biological pathways. These pathways cover various biological 
processes, including metabolism, cellular processes, genetic information processing, and human diseases. 
KEGG pathways integrate information about molecular interactions, reactions, and relationships between genes,
proteins, and other molecules, helping researchers understand complex biological functions at a systems level.

## Gene Ontology (GO)

GO is a widely used framework for describing the roles of genes and their products 
(proteins, RNAs) in biological systems. Unlike pathway databases that focus on specific molecular 
interactions, GO provides a standardized vocabulary for annotating gene functions across species in 
three main categories:

<ul>
<li>Biological Process (BP): Describes the biological goals a gene or protein contributes to, such as cell division
or metabolic processes.</li>
<li>Molecular Function (MF): Refers to the specific biochemical activities of a gene product, like binding or catalysis.</li>
<li>Cellular Component (CC): Indicates where in the cell a gene product is active, such as the nucleus, membrane,
or cytoplasm.</li>
</ul>

## The Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB)

MSigDB is a comprehensive collection of gene sets used for interpreting
high-throughput gene expression data in biological research. It is a key resource for gene set enrichment 
analysis (GSEA), helping researchers identify biological pathways, processes, and mechanisms that are 
overrepresented in a given dataset.

The Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) is divided into several major collections, each of which contains 
different sub-categories. Hereâ€™s a list of all the main categories and their sub-categories:

<ul>
<li> H: Hallmark Gene Sets. These gene sets represent fundamental biological processes, combining several 
similar gene sets into cohesive biological themes.</li>
<li> C1: Positional Gene Sets. Gene sets based on the chromosomal location of genes.</li>
<li> C2: Curated Gene Sets. C2.CP: Canonical Pathways: Gene sets derived from well-known pathway databases, 
including KEGG, Reactome, BioCarta, and others. C2.CGP: Chemical and Genetic Perturbations: Gene sets 
derived from published studies of chemical/genetic perturbations, often based on experimental data.</li>
<li> C3: Regulatory Target Gene Sets. C3.TFT: Transcription Factor Targets: Gene sets defined by 
transcription factor binding motifs. C3.MIR: microRNA Targets: Gene sets representing genes targeted by 
specific microRNAs.</li>
<li> C4: Computational Gene Sets. C4.CGN: Cancer Gene Neighborhoods: Gene sets computationally derived 
based on the relationships between genes in cancer studies. C4.CM: Cancer Modules: Gene sets based on 
modules of genes that co-vary across different cancers.</li>
<li> C5: GO Gene Sets. C5.BP: Biological Process: Gene sets from the biological process branch of Gene 
Ontology (GO). C5.CC: Cellular Component: Gene sets from the cellular component branch of GO. C5.MF: Molecular 
Function: Gene sets from the molecular function branch of GO.</li>
<li> C6: Oncogenic Signatures. Gene sets representing signatures of oncogenic pathway activation, 
often based on experimental perturbation of cancer-related genes.</li>
<li> C7: Immunologic Signatures. Gene sets derived from immunological studies, such as immune cell 
expression profiles, cytokine treatments, and immune responses.</li>
<li> C8: Cell Type Signatures. Gene sets representing the expression profiles of different cell types, 
including cell states, tissue types, and developmental stages.</li>
</ul>

## Reactome 

Reactome is a freely accessible, curated database of biological pathways that provides detailed insights 
into molecular processes across a wide range of organisms. It covers various cellular and biochemical 
processes, such as signal transduction, metabolism, gene expression, and immune responses. Each pathway 
in Reactome is represented as a network of molecular interactions, where entities like proteins, small 
molecules, and complexes participate in reactions, including binding, transport, and modifications. These 
reactions are organized hierarchically, from individual molecular events to larger biological processes.
Reactome pathways are extensively curated by domain experts and are used in functional analysis of 
high-throughput omics data (e.g., gene expression, proteomics). It integrates experimental data, enabling 
researchers to explore the molecular mechanisms behind diseases, drug responses, and other biological phenomena.



# Types of gene set enrichment analyses

Threshold-Based GSEA or Over-Representation Analysis. It requires a threshold to define "significant"
genes (e.g., p-value, fold change) and tests whether the overlap between a predefined list of 
differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and a gene set is statistically significant. 

Ranking-Based GSEA ranks all genes in a dataset based on a continuous metric (e.g., P-value, fold change,
t-statistic) and assesses whether the genes in a predefined gene set cluster at the top or bottom of 
this ranked list. 

The choice between threshold-based and ranking-based Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) depends on the
nature of the hypothesis being tested, the type of data, and the goals of the analysis.
Threshold-Based GSEA: Use for well-defined, significant subsets of genes/features when you have a justifiable 
cutoff and are interested in strong, specific signals.
Ranking-Based GSEA: Use when you want to incorporate the full dataset, avoid arbitrary cutoffs, or have a 
hypothesis that requires considering a continuous spectrum of feature significance.



# Method options to combine p-value:
<ul>
<li> Fisherâ€™s Method is sensitive to small p-values and works well when you expect strong evidence in a few tests.</li>
<li> Inverse Chi-square Method (invchisq) is more flexible than Fisherâ€™s, allowing weighting and handling of dependent or independent p-values.</li>
<li> Stoufferâ€™s Method balances contributions from small and large p-values and works well with correlated p-values.</li>
<li> Tippettâ€™s Method is highly sensitive to the smallest p-value and is best when one test is expected to show a strong signal.</li>
</ul>
